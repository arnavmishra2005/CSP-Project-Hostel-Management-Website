This is the CSP Project for Hostel Management.
<br> We are developing a website for a hostel management system.
<br> The platform will include various features that can be implemented in real-life scenarios.
<br> It offers functionalities for both students and administrators. Additionally, it can be adapted for other uses, such as room management in hostels or hotels. The website includes dynamic features like announcements and a complaint box.
<br> We have also included photos showcasing the hostel's corridors and rooms.
<br> To run the webpage, first open the index.html file. After logging in with Google, you will be redirected to admin_home.html, where the hostel management system begins.
<br> The website includes seven key features:

<ul> <li>Announcement section</li> <li>Complaint box</li> <li>In-room facilities</li> <li>Hostel facilities</li> <li>Location</li> <li>Home</li> <li>Important links</li> </ul> <br> The authors of this project are ARNAV MISHRA, AYUSH KHELWAL, and NAMAN SHARMA. <br>
